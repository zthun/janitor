# Janitor

A janitor (American English, Scottish English), custodian, porter, cleaner or caretaker is a person who cleans and
maintains buildings such as hospitals, schools, and residential accommodations
([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janitor)).

When we talk about code cleanliness, we usually are referring to coding styles and formats the keep coding projects
understandable to those who work on them.

It is not only important that your code works, but it is also important that your code is somewhat clean. This leads to
less bugs, less complaints, and less rot.

This repository contains series of tools and configurations that help with code cleanliness. By keeping our code clean
and consistent, we can focus on writing high quality working code without worrying about how it looks.
